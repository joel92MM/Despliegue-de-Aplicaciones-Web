= hibernate4: How to Use Hibernate 4 in an Application
:author: Madhumita Sadhukhan

:technologies: Hibernate 4

[abstract]
This quickstart performs the same functions as the _hibernate_ quickstart, but uses Hibernate 4 for database access. Compare this quickstart to the _hibernate_ quickstart to see the changes needed to run with Hibernate 5.

== What is it?

This quickstart is based upon the kitchensink example, but demonstrates how to use Hibernate ORM 4 over JPA in JBoss WildFly.

This project is setup to allow you to create a compliant {javaVersion} application using JSF 2.2, CDI 1.1, EJB 3.2, JPA 2.1 , Hibernate-Core and Hibernate Bean Validation. It includes a persistence unit associated with Hibernate session and some sample persistence and transaction code to help you with database access in enterprise Java.

You can compare this quickstart to the `hibernate` quickstart, which uses Hibernate 5, to see the code differences between Hibernate 4 and Hibernate 5.

== Add the Correct Dependencies

JBoss WildFly 10 provides Hibernate 5 by default. However, it is possible to use Hibernate 4 bundled within your application.

This quickstart demonstrates usage of Hibernate Session and Hibernate Validators.

If you look at the pom.xml file in the root of the hibernate4 quickstart directory, you will see that the dependencies for the Hibernate modules have been added with the `compile` scope (which is the default and thus omitted).
For example:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
   <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
   <version>${version.hibernate4}</version>
   <exclusions>
      <exclusion>
         <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
         <artifactId>slf4j-api</artifactId>
      </exclusion>
   </exclusions>
</dependency>
----

The compile scope makes sure that the Hibernate dependencies also end-up in the final WAR file.

// Start the {productName} Standalone Server
include::../shared-doc/start-the-standalone-server.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
// Build and Deploy the Quickstart
include::../shared-doc/build-and-deploy-the-quickstart.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== Access the application

The application will be running at the following URL: http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/

// Undeploy the Quickstart
include::../shared-doc/undeploy-the-quickstart.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
// Run the Quickstart in Red Hat CodeReady Studio or Eclipse
include::../shared-doc/run-the-quickstart-in-jboss-developer-studio.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== Debug the Application

If you want to debug the source code or look at the Javadocs of any library in the project, run either of the following commands to pull them into your local repository. The IDE should then detect them.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn dependency:sources
$ mvn dependency:resolve -Dclassifier=javadoc
