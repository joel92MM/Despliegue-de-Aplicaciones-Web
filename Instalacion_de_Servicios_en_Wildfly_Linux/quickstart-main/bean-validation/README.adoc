== What is it?

The `bean-validation` quickstart demonstrates how to use CDI, JPA, and Bean Validation in {productNameFull}. It includes a persistence unit and some sample persistence code to introduce you to database access in enterprise Java.

This quickstart does not contain a user interface layer. The purpose of this project is to show you how to test bean validation with Arquillian. If you want to see an example of how to test bean validation with a user interface, look at the link:../kitchensink/README{outfilesuffix}[kitchensink] example.

This quickstart is a basic example of bean validation and is not localized. Because it is not localized, English messages are hard-coded in the constraint annotations in the `Member` class to ensure the test violation messages are matched when running the {productName} server using another language. For examples of localized quickstarts, see the link:../kitchensink-ml/README{outfilesuffix}[kitchensink-ml] and link:../logging-tools/README{outfilesuffix}[logging-tools] quickstarts.

== Investigate the Console Output

When you run the Arquillian tests, Maven prints summary of the performed tests to the console. You should see the following results.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
Tests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
----

If you are interested in more details, look in the `target/surefire-reports` directory.

You can also check the server console output to verify that the Arquillian tests deployed to and ran in the application server. Search for lines similar to the following ones in the server output log:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
INFO [org.jboss.as.server.deployment] (MSC service thread 1-5) WFLYSRV0027: Starting deployment of "test.war" (runtime-name: "test.war")
...
INFO [org.jboss.as.server] (management-handler-thread - 2) WFLYSRV0010: Deployed "test.war" (runtime-name : "test.war")
...

...

== Server Log: Expected Warnings and Errors

You will see the following warnings in the server log. You can ignore these warnings.
