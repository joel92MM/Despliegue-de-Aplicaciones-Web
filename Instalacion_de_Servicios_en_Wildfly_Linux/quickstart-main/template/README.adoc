= How to Structure and Write a Quickstart README.adoc File

== Introduction

This document describes how to write a quickstart `README.adoc` file. It describes the attributes you must define and the sections needed in the correct order.

IMPORTANT: The instructions in this template only describe how to create the default instructions to run the quickstart on the WildFly or the JBoss EAP server. If the quickstart will also be deployed to OpenShift, the OpenShift instructions must be added to to this file, and you must use the `EAPCDRelease` flag to determine how to generate the `README.html` file. You can use an existing quickstart `README.adoc` file as a template.

Many instructions are common across all quickstarts. These have been moved to files located in the `shared-doc/` directory. Rather than write them again, you can just include those files in your `README.adoc` file. Some of these included files have conditional logic and require that you define a document attribute to determine how the instructions should print for your quickstart.

* You must first xref:define_the_heading[define the heading or title] for your quickstart.
* Next, you must xref:define_the_metadata[define the metadata] that defines the quickstart.
* determine what will display information about the quickstart and how the instructions will look.
* Finally, you must determine which sections are needed for your quickstart and include or write them as needed.

TIP: Find an existing quickstart that is similar to the one you are creating and make a copy of its `README.adoc` file to use for your own quickstart project. Then update the file as needed.

[[define_the_heading]]
== Define the Heading

This is the first line of the `README.adoc` file and it defines the quickstart name and provides a short description.

* Start the heading with "= ".
* This is followed by the __QUICKSTART_NAME__, which should match the folder name.
* Try to limit the decription to 55 characters as it is displayed in a table and also used in search engines.

.Example: Quickstart Heading
[source,subs="+quotes",options="nowrap"]
----
= __QUICKSTART_NAME__: Brief Description of the Quickstart (try to limit the description to 55 characters)
----

[[define_the_metadata]]
== Define the Metadata for the Quickstart

. Copy in the following standard metadata attributes and modify where needed.
+
.Example: Basic Attributes
----
:author: __YOUR_NAME__ and optional CONTACT_INFO
:productName: WildFly
:productNameFull: WildFly Application Server
:jbossHomeName: WILDFLY_HOME
:productVersion: 19
:buildRequirements: Java 8.0 (Java SDK 1.8) or later and Maven 3.3.1 or later
----

. Include the following shared attribute file.
+
.Example: Include the attributes.adoc File
----
 include::../shared-doc/attributes.adoc[]
----

. Define additional attributes for this quickstart.
+
Define the following attributes that provide information about the level of expertise required and the technologies used by the quickstart. They are used when building the quickstart table in the root `README.html` file.
+
.Example: Quickstart Informational Attributes
----
:level: (one of the following: Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced)
:technologies: (list technologies used here)
:source: (The URL for the repository that is the source of record for this quickstart)
:prerequisites: (list any quickstarts that must be deployed prior to running this one)
----

. Create the abstract. This is also used in the quickstart table in the root `README.html` file.
+
.Example: Quickstart Abstract
----
[abstract]
Create a  brief description of the quickstart. This description appears in the table and in Google search SEO results. Try to limit the description to 155 characters.
----

== Define Conditional Attributes for the Quickstart

Many commonly used instructions are defined in shared topic files located in the `shared-doc/` folder. Some require that you set attribute values specific to your quickstart that can be used for conditional text. Examples include the following.

.Example: Attributes Need by Included Shared Topics

:performance-scalability: Define this attribute if the user needs to consider scalability when using this quickstart example.
:requires-multiple-servers: Define this attribute if you must start 2 servers.
:optional-domain-or-multiple-servers: Define this attribute if the quickstart requires that you configure and start multiple servers.
:jbds-not-supported: Define this attribute if the quickstart does not run in {JBDSProductName}
