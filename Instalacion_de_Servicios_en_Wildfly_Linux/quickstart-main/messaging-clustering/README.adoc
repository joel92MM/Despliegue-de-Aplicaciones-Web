[abstract]
The `messaging-clustering` quickstart does not contain any code and instead uses the `helloworld-mdb` quickstart to demonstrate clustering using ActiveMQ Messaging.

:standalone-server-type: full-ha
:archiveType: war
:optional-domain-or-multiple-servers:
:jbds-not-supported:

== What is it?

The `messaging-clustering` quickstart demonstrates the use of clustering with Apache ActiveMQ and {productNameFull}. It uses the link:../helloworld-mdb/README{outfilesuffix}[helloworld-mdb] quickstart for its tests, so there is no code associated with this quickstart. Instructions are provided to run the quickstart on either a standalone server or in a managed domain.

// System Requirements
include::../shared-doc/system-requirements.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
// Use of {jbossHomeName}_1 and {jbossHomeName}_2
include::../shared-doc/use-of-jboss-home-name.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== Prerequisites

IMPORTANT: This quickstart depends on the deployment of the `helloworld-mdb` quickstart WAR for its tests. Before you continue, you must build the `helloworld-mdb` quickstart WAR.

Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the helloworld-mdb quickstart.
Type this command to build the WAR archive:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean install
----

See the `helloworld-mdb` link:../helloworld-mdb/README{outfilesuffix}[helloworld-mdb README] file for further information about this quickstart.

== Configure the Server and Deploy the Quickstart

You can choose to deploy and run this quickstart in a managed domain or on a standalone server. The sections below describe how to configure and start each type of server.

Before you begin:

. If it is running, stop the {productName} server.
. If you plan to test using a standalone server, back up the standalone server configuration file:
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
__{jbossHomeName}__/standalone/configuration/standalone-full-ha.xml
----

. If you plan to test using a managed domain, back up the following files:
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
__{jbossHomeName}__/domain/configuration/domain.xml
__{jbossHomeName}__/domain/configuration/host.xml
----

After you have completed testing this quickstart, you can replace these files to restore the server to its original configuration.

=== Configure the Server and Deploy the Quickstart to a Managed Domain

You configure the server by running the install-domain.cli script provided in the root directory of this quickstart.

// Start the {productName} Managed Domain
include::../shared-doc/start-the-managed-domain.adoc[leveloffset=+3]

==== Configure the Domain Server and Deploy the Quickstart Using the JBoss CLI

. Review the `install-domain.cli` file in the root of this quickstart directory. This script creates the server group and servers and configures messaging clustering for testing this quickstart. You will note it does the following:

** Stops the servers
** Creates a server-group to test ActiveMQ Clustering
** Adds 2 servers to the server-group
** Configures ActiveMQ clustering in the full-ha profile
** Deploys the `helloworld-mdb.war` archive
** Restarts the servers.
+
NOTE: If your `helloworld-mdb` quickstart is not located at the same level in the file structure as this quickstart, you must modify its path in this script. Find the `NOTE` in the file for instructions.

. Open a terminal, navigate to the root directory of this quickstart, and run the following command to run the script:
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=install-domain.cli
----
+
NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\jboss-cli.bat` script.

+
You should see `"outcome" => "success"` for all of the commands.

. Restart the server in a managed domainas described above.

=== Configure the Server and Deploy the Quickstart to a Standalone Server

If you choose to run standalone servers instead of a managed domain, you will need two instances of the application server.
Application server 2 must be started with a port offset parameter provided to the startup script as `-Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100`.

Since both application servers must be configured in the same way, you must configure the first server and then clone it.

[[start_the_eap_standalone_server]]
==== Start the Standalone Server Using the Full HA Profile.

. Open a terminal and navigate to the root of the {productName} directory.
. Start the {productName} server with the standalone full HA profile, which supports messaging and high availability, by typing the following command.
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full-ha.xml
----
+
NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\standalone.bat` script.

==== Configure the Standalone Server and Deploy the Quickstart Using the JBoss CLI

. Review the `install-standalone.cli` file in the root of this quickstart directory. This script configures clustering for a standalone server. You will note it does the following:
** Enables console logging. By default, the full HA profile does not log to the console, so this script enables it.
** Enables clustering and sets a cluster password
** Enables clustering in the RemoteConnectionFactory
** Deploys the `helloworld-mdb.war` archive
** Reloads the server configuration
+
NOTE: If your `helloworld-mdb` quickstart is not located at the same level in the file structure as this quickstart, you must modify its path in this script. Find the `NOTE` in the file for instructions.

. Open a terminal, navigate to the root directory of this quickstart, and run the following command to run the script:
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}_1__/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=install-standalone.cli
----
+
NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}_1\bin\jboss-cli.bat__` script.

You should see `"outcome" => "success"` for all of the commands.

==== Clone the {productName} Directory

After you have successfully configured the server, you must make a copy of this {productName} directory structure to use for the second server.

. Stop the server.
. Make a copy of this {productName} directory structure to use for the second server.
. Remove the following directories from the cloned instance:
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
__{jbossHomeName}_2__/standalone/data/activemq/bindings/
__{jbossHomeName}_2__/standalone/data/activemq/journal/
__{jbossHomeName}_2__/standalone/data/activemq/largemessages/
----

[[start_the_eap_standalone_servers]]
==== Start the {productName} Standalone Servers with the Full HA Profile

When you start the servers, you must pass the cluster password on the command line to avoid the warning `AMQ222186: unable to authorise cluster control`.

[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}_1__/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full-ha.xml
$ __{jbossHomeName}_2__/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full-ha.xml -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100
----

NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}_1__\bin\standalone.bat` and `__{jbossHomeName}_2__\bin\standalone.bat` scripts.
