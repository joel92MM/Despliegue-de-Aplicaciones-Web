[abstract]
The `wsat-simple` quickstart demonstrates a WS-AT (WS-AtomicTransaction) enabled JAX-WS Web service, bundled as a WAR, and deployed to {productName}.

:standalone-server-type: custom
:archiveType: war

== What is it?

The `wsat-simple` quickstart demonstrates the deployment of a WS-AT (WS-AtomicTransaction) enabled JAX-WS Web service bundled in a WAR archive for deployment to {productNameFull}.

The Web service is offered by a Restaurant for making bookings. The Service allows bookings to be made within an Atomic Transaction.

This example demonstrates the basics of implementing a WS-AT enabled Web service. It is beyond the scope of this quick start to demonstrate more advanced features. In particular:

* The Service does not implement the required hooks to support recovery in the presence of failures.
* It also does not utilize a transactional back-end resource.
* Only one web service participates in the protocol. As WS-AT is a 2PC coordination protocol, it is best suited to multi-participant scenarios.

For a more complete example, please see the XTS demonstrator application that ships with the Narayana project: http://narayana.io/.

It is also assumed that you have an understanding of WS-AtomicTransaction. For more details, read the XTS documentation that ships with the Narayana project: http://narayana.io/docs/product.

The application consists of a single JAX-WS web service that is deployed within a WAR archive. It is tested with a JBoss Arquillian enabled JUnit test.

When running the `org.jboss.as.quickstarts.wsat.simple.ClientTest#testCommit()` method, the following steps occur:

. A new Atomic Transaction (AT) is created by the client.
. An operation on a WS-AT enabled Web service is invoked by the client.
. The JaxWSHeaderContextProcessor in the WS Client handler chain inserts the WS-AT context into the outgoing SOAP message
. When the service receives the SOAP request, the JaxWSHeaderContextProcessor in its handler chain inspects the WS-AT context and associates the request with this AT.
. The Web service operation is invokedâ€¦
. A participant is enlisted in this AT. This allows the Web Service logic to respond to protocol events, such as Commit and Rollback.
. The service invokes the business logic. In this case, a booking is made with the restaurant.
. The backend resource is prepared. This ensures that the Backend resource can undo or make permanent the change when told to do so by the coordinator.
. The client can then decide to commit or rollback the AT. If the client decides to commit, the coordinator will begin the 2PC protocol. If the participant decides to rollback, all participants will be told to rollback.

There is another test that shows what happens if the client decides to rollback the AT.

[[start_the_eap_standalone_server]]
== Start the {productName} Standalone Server

You must start {productName} with the XTS subsystem enabled.

. Edit the log level to reduce the amount of log output. This should make it easier to read the logs produced by this example. To do this add the following logger block to the `__{jbossHomeName}__/docs/examples/configs/standalone-xts.xml` of your JBoss distribution. You should add it just below one of the other logger blocks.
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<logger category="org.apache.cxf.service.factory.ReflectionServiceFactoryBean">
    <level name="WARN"/>
</logger>
----

. Open a terminal and navigate to the root of the {productName} directory.
. Start the {productName} server with XTS subsystem enabled by typing the following command.
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/standalone.sh --server-config=../../docs/examples/configs/standalone-xts.xml
----
+
NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\standalone.bat` script.

// Run the Arquillian Tests

[[investigate_the_console_output]]
== Investigate the Console Output

When you run the Arquillian tests, Maven prints summary of the performed tests to the console. You should see the following results.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
Results :

Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
----

[NOTE]
====
You see the following warning when you run the Arquillian tests in remote mode.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
WARNING: Configuration contain properties not supported by the backing object org.jboss.as.arquillian.container.remote.RemoteContainerConfiguration
Unused property entries: {serverConfig=../../docs/examples/configs/standalone-xts.xml}
Supported property names: [managementAddress, password, managementPort, managementProtocol, username]
----

This is because, in remote mode, you are responsible for starting the server with the XTS subsystem enabled. When you run the Arquillian tests in managed mode, the container uses the `serverConfig` property defined in the `arquillian.xml` file to start the server with the XTS subsystem enabled.

The following messages should appear in the server log. The messages trace the steps taken by the tests. Note there may be other informational log messages interlaced between these.

NOTE: You can ignore the warning message `ARJUNA043219: Could not save recovery state for non-serializable durable WS-AT participant restaurantServiceAT` that is printed in the server console. This quickstart does not implement the required recovery hooks in the interest of making it easy to follow. In a real world production application, you should provide the required recovery code. For more information, see http://narayana.io/docs/product.
