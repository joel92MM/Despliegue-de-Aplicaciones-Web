[abstract]
Demonstrates use of a Javascript WebSocket client, WebSocket configuration, programmatic binding, and secure WebSocket.

== What is it?

The `websocket-client` quickstart demonstrates how to use the Java API for WebSockets to create Java client endpoint connected to a remote WebSocket server.

The example is modeled as a relay between a front-end WebSocket server endpoint and a back-end WebSocket client endpoint.

Message Flow: +
`Browser Javascript WebSocket Client` -> `{productName} WebSocket Server Endpoint` -> ``{productName} Websocket Client Endpoint` -> `Remote WebSocket Echo Server`

CDI events are used to pass messages between the front-end and back-end servers. A single back-end WebSocket client endpoint is shared for all front-end clients.

The remote WebSocket server must be an `Echo` server; a simple WebSocket server that echos back messages the client sends for the purpose of testing. Such a server is publicly available at ws://echo.websocket.org, but any echo server will work.

`Frontend` does not use WebSocket annotations because it demonstrates how to use `ServerEndpointConfig` to modify the default `Configurator` to use an application scoped Endpoint, and how to deploy the Endpoint programatically.

`Backend` does not use WebSocket annotations because it demonstrates how to use `ClientEndpointConfig` to configure the WebSocket client to connect to a secure (wss) WebSocket.

== Access the Application

Access the running application in a browser at the following URL: http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/

You are presented with the `WebSocket Echo Replay` page confirming the connection to the remote WebSocket _Echo_ server.

[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
Connecting to ws://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/relay
RECV: Opened frontend session __FRONTEND_SESSION_ID__
----

Type a message in the text input field at the bottom of the page and click `Send`. The message is processed and the form displays the relayed results. The message `This is a test` was used in the following example.

[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
SEND: This is a test
RECV: BROADCAST: Connecting to backend wss://echo.websocket.org
RECV: BROADCAST: Opened backend session __BACKEND_SESSION_ID__
RECV: Sending message from frontend session __FRONTEND_SESSION_ID__
RECV: Received message from backend session __BACKEND_SESSION_ID__
RECV: This is a test
