Demonstrates how to use the Wicket Framework 7.x with the JBoss server using the Wicket Jakarta EE integration packaged as a WAR

:standalone-server-type: default
:archiveType: war

== What is it?

This is an example of how to use Wicket Framework 7.x with WildFly, leveraging features of {javaVersion}, using the Wicket-Stuff Jakarta EE integration.

Features used:

* Injection of `@PersistenceContext`
* Injection of a value from `web.xml` using `@Resource`
* Injection of a stateless session bean using `@EJB`

This is a WAR version.
