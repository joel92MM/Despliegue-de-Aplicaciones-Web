== What is it?

The `helloworld-html5` quickstart demonstrates the use of CDI 1.2 and JAX-RS 2.0 in {productNameFull} {productVersion} or later using the HTML5 + REST architecture.

The application is basically a smart, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript front-end using RESTful services on the backend.

* `HelloWorld.java`: Establishes the RESTful endpoints using JAX-RS.
* `web.xml`: Maps RESTful endpoints to `/hello`.
* `index.html`: Is a jQuery augmented plain old HTML5 web page.

The example can be deployed using Maven from the command line or from Eclipse using JBoss Tools.
