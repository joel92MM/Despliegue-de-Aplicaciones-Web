Based on kitchensink, but uses a Angular for the front end and Undertow.js for the back end.

== What is it?

This quickstart is a deployable Maven 3 project to help you get your foot in the door developing with Undertow.js and {javaVersion} on JBoss WildFly.

This project is setup to allow you to create a compliant {javaVersion} application using Undertow.js CDI 1.1, JPA 2.1 and Bean Validation 1.1. It includes a persistence unit and some sample persistence and transaction code to introduce you to database access in Undertow.js.
