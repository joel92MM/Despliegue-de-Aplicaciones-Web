[abstract]
The `ejb-security-programmatic-auth` quickstart demonstrates how to programmatically setup different identities when invoking a remote secured EJB.

== What is it?

The `ejb-security-programmatic-auth` quickstart demonstrates how to invoke a remote secured EJB using the `Elytron` client API to establish different identities. The quickstart client application accomplishes that by looking up and invoking the secured EJB under different `AuthenticationContext`s. Each context is setup to use a different identities and credentials.

== Configure the Server

You configure the security domain by running JBoss CLI commands. For your convenience, this quickstart batches the commands into a `configure-elytron.cli` script provided in the root directory of this quickstart.

. Before you begin, make sure you do the following:

* xref:back_up_standalone_server_configuration[Back up the {productName} standalone server configuration] as described above.
* xref:start_the_eap_standalone_server[Start the {productName} server with the standalone default profile] as described above.

. Review the `configure-elytron.cli` file in the root of this quickstart directory. This script adds the configuration that enables Elytron security for the quickstart components. Comments in the script describe the purpose of each block of commands.
. Open a new terminal, navigate to the root directory of this quickstart, and run the following command, replacing `__{jbossHomeName}__` with the path to your server.
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=configure-elytron.cli
----
+
NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\jboss-cli.bat` script.

+
You should see the following result when you run the script.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
The batch executed successfully
process-state: reload-required
----

. Stop the {productName} server.

== Review the Modified Server Configuration

After stopping the server, open the `__{jbossHomeName}__/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file and review the changes.

. The following `application-security-domain` mapping was added to the `ejb3` subsystem:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<application-security-domains>
    <application-security-domain name="quickstart-domain" security-domain="ApplicationDomain"/>
</application-security-domains>
----
+
The `application-security-domain` essentially enables Elytron security for the quickstart EJBs. It maps the `quickstart-domain` that was set in the EJBs via annotation to the Elytron `ApplicationDomain` that will be responsible for authenticating and authorizing access to the EJBs.

. The `http-connector` in the `remoting` subsystem was updated to use the `application-sasl-authentication` authentication factory:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<http-connector name="http-remoting-connector" connector-ref="default" security-realm="ApplicationRealm" sasl-authentication-factory="application-sasl-authentication"/>
----
+
This allows for the identity that was established in the connection authentication to be propagated to the components.

// Build and Deploy the Quickstart
include::../shared-doc/build-and-deploy-the-quickstart.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== Access the Application

Before you run the client, make sure you have already successfully deployed the EJBs to the server in the previous step and that your terminal is still in the same folder.

Type the following command to execute the client.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn exec:exec
----

== Investigate the Console Output

When you run the `mvn exec:exec` command, you see the following output. Note there may be other log messages interspersed between these.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
Called secured bean, caller principal quickstartUser

Principal has admin permission: false
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
Called secured bean, caller principal quickstartAdmin

Principal has admin permission: true
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
----

As expected, the `quickstart` user is able to call the methods available for `guest`, but does not have the `admin` permission to call administrative methods on the remote EJB. The `quickstartAdmin` on the other hand has permissions to call both methods.
