== What is it?

The `resteasy-jaxrs-client` quickstart demonstrates an external JAX-RS RestEasy client which interacts with a JAX-RS Web service that uses CDI and JAX-RS in {productNameFull}.

This client "calls" the HelloWorld JAX-RS Web Service that was created in the link:../helloworld-rs/README.adoc[helloworld-rs] quickstart. See the *Prerequisite* section below for details on how to build and deploy the link:../helloworld-rs/README.adoc[helloworld-rs] quickstart.

[[prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

IMPORTANT: This quickstart depends on the deployment of the `helloworld-rs` quickstart for its test. Before running this quickstart, see the link:../helloworld-rs/README.adoc[helloworld-rs] README file for details on how to deploy it.

You can verify the deployment of the link:../helloworld-rs/README.adoc[helloworld-rs] quickstart by accessing the following content:

* The XML content can be viewed by accessing the following URL: http://localhost:8080/helloworld-rs/rest/xml
* The JSON content can be viewed by accessing this URL: http://localhost:8080/helloworld-rs/rest/json

== Run the Client

. xref:start_the_eap_standalone_server[Start the {productName} server with the standalone default profile] as described above.
. Make sure the `helloworld-rs` quickstart has been deployed on the server as noted in the xref:prerequisites[Prerequisites] section above.
. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
. Type the following command to run the client:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean package exec:java

== Investigate the Console Output

This command will compile the example and execute a test to make two separate requests to the Web Service. Towards the end of the Maven build output, you
should see the following if the execution is successful:

[source,options="nowrap"]
