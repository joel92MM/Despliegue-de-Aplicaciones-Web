== What is it?

The `hibernate` quickstart is based upon the link:../kitchensink/README{outfilesuffix}[kitchensink] example, but demonstrates how to use Hibernate Object/Relational Mapping (ORM) 5 over JPA in {productNameFull}.

This project is setup to allow you to create a compliant {javaVersion} application using JSF, CDI, EJB, JPA , Hibernate-Core and Hibernate Bean Validation. It includes a persistence unit associated with Hibernate session and some sample persistence and transaction code to help you with database access in enterprise Java.

== Add the Correct Dependencies

{productName} provides Hibernate 5 and JPA support.

If you use Hibernate 5 packaged within {productName}, you will need to first import the JPA API.

This quickstart demonstrates usage of Hibernate Session and Hibernate Validators.

If you look at the `pom.xml` file in the root of the hibernate quickstart directory, you will see that the dependencies for the Hibernate modules have been added with the scope as `provided`.

For example:
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
   <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
