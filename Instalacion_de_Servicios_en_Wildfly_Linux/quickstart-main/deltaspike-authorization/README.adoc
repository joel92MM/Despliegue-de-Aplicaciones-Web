[abstract]
Demonstrate the creation of a custom authorization example using @SecurityBindingType from DeltaSpike


== What is it?

Security binding is DeltaSpike feature that restricts who can invoke a method (under the covers, it uses interceptors).

To restrict who can invoke a method, we create an annotation, called a security binding type. This quickstart has two security binding types - `@AdminAllowed` and `@GuestAllowed`.

The quickstart defines an `Authorizer` class that implements the restrictions for the security binding types. The authorizer is a CDI bean which defines methods (annotated with `@Secures) which perform the authorization checks for each security binding we create.

In this quickstart the `Authorizer` we delegate authentication to JAAS, but other authentication solutions could be used.

Methods on the `Controller` bean have been restricted using the security binding types.

== Access the application

The application will be running at the following URL: http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/.

When you access the application you are redirected to a login form, already filled in with the details of the application user you set up above. Once you have logged into the application you see a page showing your username and two buttons.

When you click on the `Employee Method` button you will see the following message: `You executed a @EmployeeAllowed method` - you are authorized to invoke this method.

When you click on the `Admin Method` button, you are redirected to an error page with the following exception: `org.apache.deltaspike.security.api.authorization.AccessDeniedException` because you aren't authorized to invoke this method.

== Debug the Application

If you want to debug the source code or look at the Javadocs of any library in the project, run either of the following commands to pull them into your local repository. The IDE should then detect them.
