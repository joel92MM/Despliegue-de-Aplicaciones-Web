The `spring-greeter` quickstart is based on the `greeter` quickstart, but differs in that it uses Spring MVC for Mapping `GET` and `POST` requests.

== What is it?

The application this project produces is designed to be run on {productNameFull} {productVersion} or later.

The `spring-greeter` quickstart is based on the `greeter` quickstart, but differs in that it uses Spring MVC for Mapping `GET` and `POST` requests:

* The `mvc:annotation-driven` element configured in the `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/spring-mvc-context.xml` file tells Spring to look for `@RequestMapping` in the controllers.
* Spring then routes the HTTP requests to the correct methods in `CreateController.java` and `GreetController`

Spring's XML configurations are used to get hold of the database and entity manager (via jndi) to perform transactional operations:

* The `tx:jta-transaction-manager` and `tx:annotation-driven` elements are configured in the `/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/spring-business-context.xml` file.
* Methods in UserDaoImpl are marked as `@Transactional`, which Spring, using aspect oriented programming, surrounds with
boilerplate code to make the methods transactional

When you deploy this example, two users are automatically created for you: emuster and jdoe. This data is located in the
`src/main/resources/init-db.sql` file.

To test this example:

. Enter a name in the username field and click on *Greet!*.
. If you enter a username that is not in the database, you get a message `No such user exists!``.
. If you enter a valid username, you get a message "Hello, " followed by the user's first and last name.
. To create a new user, click the *Add a new user* link. Enter the *username*, *first name*, and *last name*, and then click *Add User*.
The user is added and a message displays the new user ID number.
. Click on the *Greet a user!* link to return to the *Greet!* page.
