== What is it

The `bean-validation-custom-constraint` quickstart demonstrates how to use CDI, JPA, and Bean Validation in {productNameFull}. Bean Validation API allows the developers to define their own constraints by creating a new annotation and writing the validator which is used to validate the value. This quickstart will show you how to create custom constraints and then use it to validate your data. It includes a persistence unit and some sample persistence code to introduce you to database access in enterprise Java.

This quickstart does not contain a user interface layer. The purpose of this project is to show you how to test bean validation using custom constraints with Arquillian. In this quickstart, the personAddress field of entity Person is validated using a set of custom constraints defined in the class AddressValidator. If you want to see an example of how to test bean validation with a user interface, look at the link:../kitchensink/README{outfilesuffix}[kitchensink] example.

== Investigate the Console Output

When you run the Arquillian tests, Maven prints summary of the performed tests to the console. You should see the following results.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
----

If you are interested in more details, look in the `target/surefire-reports` directory.

You can also check the server console output to verify that the Arquillian tests deployed to and ran in the application server. Search for lines similar to the following ones in the server output log:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
INFO [org.jboss.as.server.deployment] (MSC service thread 1-5) WFLYSRV0027: Starting deployment of "test.war" (runtime-name: "test.war")
...
INFO [org.jboss.as.server] (management-handler-thread - 2) WFLYSRV0010: Deployed "test.war" (runtime-name : "test.war")
...
INFO [org.jboss.as.server.deployment] (MSC service thread 1-3) WFLYSRV0028: Stopped deployment test.war (runtime-name: test.war) in 32ms
...
INFO [[org.jboss.as.server] (management-handler-thread - 2) WFLYSRV0009: Undeployed "test.war" (runtime-name: "test.war")

== Server Log: Expected Warnings and Errors

You will see the following warnings in the server log. You can ignore these warnings.
