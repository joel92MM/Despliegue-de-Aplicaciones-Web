[abstract]
The `ejb-in-war` quickstart demonstrates how to package an EJB bean in a WAR archive and deploy it to {productName}. Arquillian tests are also provided.

:standalone-server-type: default
:archiveType: war

== What is it?

The `ejb-in-war` quickstart demonstrates the deployment of an EJB bean bundled in a WAR archive for deployment to {productNameFull}. The project also includes a set of Arquillian tests for the managed bean and EJB.

The example follows the common "Hello World" pattern using the following workflow.

. A JSF page asks for the user name.
. On clicking *Greet*, the name is sent to a managed bean named `Greeter`.
. On setting the name, the `Greeter` invokes the `GreeterEJB`, which was injected into the managed bean. Notice the field annotated with `@EJB`.
. The response from invoking the `GreeterEJB` is stored in a field `message` of the managed bean.
. The managed bean is annotated as `@SessionScoped`, so the same managed bean instance is used for the entire session. This ensures that the message is available when the page reloads and is displayed to the user.

== Access the Application

The application will be running at the following URL http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/.

// Undeploy the Quickstart

// Run the Arquillian Tests
include::../shared-doc/run-arquillian-tests.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== Investigate the Console Output

When you run the Arquillian tests, Maven prints summary of the performed tests to the console. You should see the following results.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
----

If you are interested in more details, check `target/surefire-reports` directory.
You can check console output to verify that Arquillian has really used the real application server.
Search for lines similar to the following ones in the server output log:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
