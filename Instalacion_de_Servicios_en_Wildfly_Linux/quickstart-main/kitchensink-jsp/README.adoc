== What is it?

The `kitchensink-jsp` quickstart is a deployable Maven 3 project and demonstrates how to create a compliant {javaVersion} application using JSP 2.0, EL 2.0, JSTL 1.2, CDI, EJB, JPA, and Bean Validation in {productNameFull}.

This example is based on the link:../kitchensink/README.adoc[kitchensink] quickstart, but recreates the presentation tier using JSP and JSTL instead of JSF features. It reuses all other components from the Member Registration template. It also reuses the persistence unit and some sample persistence and transaction code to help you with database access in enterprise Java.
