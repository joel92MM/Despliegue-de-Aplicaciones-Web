== Invoking management port in the Openshift environment

In the Openshift environment the management port is not exposed. For this
reason we need to access the health endpoint exposed on the management port manually by SSH.
There are two ways to get access to the Openshift pod:

- terminal - you can get the name of your running pod with `oc get pods` (it will be something like `{ImagePrefixVersion}-basic-app-1-vpfdn`) and by executing `oc rsh {pod-name}` (oc rsh {ImagePrefixVersion}-basic-app-1-vpfdn)

- UI - In the Openshift console navigate to the `Topology` tab and click your application
(`{ImagePrefixVersion}-basic-app`). Open the `Resources` tab and click the pod name under the `Pods` tab
(it will be something like `{ImagePrefixVersion}-basic-app-1-vpfdn`). Now just click the `Terminal` tab and
you will get a terminal into the pod.

In the opened terminal you can now execute the cURL commands invoking the localhost in the
similar manner as in bare metal deployment (e.g. `curl {include-management-port}`).

== Other post deployment tasks
endif::[]

Depending on your application, you might need to complete some tasks after your OpenShift application has been built and deployed.

Examples of post-deployment tasks include the following:

* Exposing a service so that the application is viewable from outside of OpenShift.
* Scaling your application to a specific number of replicas.

.Procedure

. Get the service name of your application using the following command.
+
[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc get service
----

. *Optional*: Expose the main service as a route so you can access your application from outside of OpenShift. For example, for the previously created application, use the following command to expose the required service and port.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you used a template to create the application, the route might already exist. If it does, continue on to the next step.
====

+
[options="nowrap",subs="+attributes"]
----
$ oc expose service/{ImagePrefixVersion}-basic-app --port=8080
----
+

. Get the URL of the route.
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc get route
----
. Access the application in your web browser using the URL. The URL is the value of the `HOST/PORT` field from previous command's output.
+
[NOTE]
====

For example, to interact with this quickstart , the root of its application URLs should be `https://_HOST_PORT_Value_/`.
====
+

. Optionally, you can scale up the application instance by running the following command. This command increases the number of replicas to 3.
+
[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc scale deploymentconfig __DEPLOYMENTCONFIG_NAME__ --replicas=3
----
+
For example, for this` quickstart, use the following command to scale up the application.
+
[options="nowrap",subs="+attributes"]
----
$ oc scale deploymentconfig/{ImagePrefixVersion}-basic-app --replicas=3
----
