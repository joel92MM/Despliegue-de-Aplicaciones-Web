= Install AMQ Streams on Openshift

The functionality of this quickstart depends on a running instance of the
https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-amq#streams[AMQ Streams] Operator. AMQ Streams is a Red Hat project based on Apache Kafka. To deploy AMQ Streams in the Openshift environment:

. Log in into the Openshift console as `kubeadmin` user (or any cluster administrator).
. Navigate to `Operators` -> `OperatorHub`.
. Search for `AMQ Streams` - click on the 'Red Hat Integration - AMQ Streams' operator (works with both community and Red Hat).
Install it with the default values.
. Run the following command to set up a Kafka cluster called `my-cluster` in your project:
+
