[abstract]
The `helloworld-mutual-ssl-secured` quickstart demonstrates securing a Web application using client mutual SSL authentication and role-based access control

:standalone-server-type: default
:archiveType: war
:restoreScriptName: restore-configuration.cli
:app-user-groups: JBossAdmin

== What is it?

This example demonstrates the configuration of _mutual SSL authentication_ in {productNameFull} {productVersion} to secure a war application.

Mutual SSL provides the same security as SSL, with the addition of authentication and non-repudiation of the client authentication, using digital signatures. When mutual authentication is used, the server would request the client to provide a certificate in addition to the server certificate issued to the client. Mutual authentication requires an extra round trip time for client certificate exchange. In addition, the client must buy and maintain a digital certificate. We can secure our war application deployed over {productName} with mutual(two-way) client certificate authentication and provide access permissions or privileges to legitimate users.

This quickstart shows how to configure {productName} to enable TLS/SSL configuration for the new {productName} `undertow` subsystem and enable mutual (two-way) SSL authentication for clients in order to secure a WAR application with restricted access.

//  Add the Authorized Application User

IMPORTANT: For the purpose of this quickstart the password can contain any valid value because the `ApplicationRealm` will be used for authorization only, for example, to obtain the security roles.

== Set Up Client and Server Keystores Using Java Keytool

. Open a terminal and navigate to the {productName} server `configuration` directory:
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ cd __{jbossHomeName}__/standalone/configuration/
----

. Create a certificate for your server using the following command.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$>keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -keystore server.keystore -storepass secret -keypass secret -validity 365

What is your first and last name?
   [Unknown]:  localhost
What is the name of your organizational unit?
   [Unknown]:  wildfly
What is the name of your organization?
   [Unknown]:  jboss
What is the name of your City or Locality?
   [Unknown]:  Raleigh
What is the name of your State or Province?
   [Unknown]:  Carolina
What is the two-letter country code for this unit?
   [Unknown]:  US
Is CN=localhost, OU=wildfly, O=jboss, L=Raleigh, ST=Carolina, C=US correct?
   [no]:  yes
----

. Create the client certificate, which is used to authenticate against the server when accessing a resource through SSL.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$>keytool -genkey -keystore client.keystore -storepass secret -validity 365 -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -storetype pkcs12

What is your first and last name?
    [Unknown]:  quickstartUser
What is the name of your organizational unit?
    [Unknown]:  Sales
What is the name of your organization?
    [Unknown]:  My Company
What is the name of your City or Locality?
    [Unknown]:  Sao Paulo
What is the name of your State or Province?
    [Unknown]:  Sao Paulo
What is the two-letter country code for this unit?
    [Unknown]:  BR
Is CN=quickstartUser, OU=Sales, O=My Company, L=Sao Paulo, ST=Sao Paulo, C=BR correct?
    [no]:  yes
----

+
Notice that it sets the `first and last name` to `quickstartUser` and that this matches the user that was added to the `ApplicationRealm`. When authorizing access to a resource, the CN (common name) of the client's certificate is extracted by a principal decoder and this name is then used by the `ApplicationRealm` to obtain the client's roles.

. Export the client certificate and create a truststore by importing this certificate.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]

Trust this certificate? [no]:  yes
Certificate was added to keystore
----
+
It is worth noticing that the client certificate was imported under the `quickstartUser` alias. When authenticating a client in a `CLIENT_CERT` configuration, the CN (common name) of the client's certificate is extracted by a principal decoder and this name is then used by the `KeyStoreRealm` to match an alias in the trust store. If a trusted certificate is found under this alas, the client is considered authenticated.

. Export client certificate to pkcs12 format.

----
$>keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore client.keystore -srcstorepass secret -destkeystore clientCert.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 -deststoretype PKCS12 -deststorepass secret
----

. The certificates and keystores are now properly configured.

[[configure_the_server]]
== Configure the Server

You configure the SSL context and required security domain by running JBoss CLI commands. For your convenience, this quickstart batches the commands into a `configure-ssl.cli` script provided in the root directory of this quickstart.

. Before you begin, make sure you do the following:

* xref:back_up_standalone_server_configuration[Back up the {productName} standalone server configuration] as described above.
* xref:start_the_eap_standalone_server[Start the {productName} server with the standalone default profile] as described above.

. Review the `configure-ssl.cli` file in the root of this quickstart directory. Comments in the script describe the purpose of each block of commands.
. Open a new terminal, navigate to the root directory of this quickstart, and run the following command, replacing __{jbossHomeName}__ with the path to your server:
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=configure-ssl.cli
----
+
NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\jboss-cli.bat` script.

+
You should see the following result when you run the script.
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
The batch executed successfully
process-state: reload-required
----

. Stop the {productName} server.

== Review the Modified Server Configuration

After stopping the server, open the `__{jbossHomeName}__/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file and review the changes.

. The following `key-store`s were added to the `elytron` subsystem:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<key-store name="qsKeyStore">
    <credential-reference clear-text="secret"/>
    <implementation type="JKS"/>
    <file path="server.keystore" relative-to="jboss.server.config.dir"/>
</key-store>
<key-store name="qsTrustStore">
    <credential-reference clear-text="secret"/>
    <implementation type="JKS"/>
    <file path="client.truststore" relative-to="jboss.server.config.dir"/>
</key-store>
----

. The following `key-manager` was added to the `elytron` subsystem:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<key-managers>
    <key-manager name="qsKeyManager" key-store="qsKeyStore">
        <credential-reference clear-text="secret"/>
    </key-manager>
</key-managers>
----

. The following `trust-manager` was added to the `elytron` subsystem:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<trust-managers>
    <trust-manager name="qsTrustManager" key-store="qsTrustStore"/>
</trust-managers>
----

. The following `ssl-context` was added to the `elytron` subsystem:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<server-ssl-contexts>
    <server-ssl-context name="qsSSLContext" protocols="TLSv1.2" need-client-auth="true" key-manager="qsKeyManager" trust-manager="qsTrustManager"/>
</server-ssl-contexts>
----

. The following realms were added to the `elytron` subsystem:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<key-store-realm name="KeyStoreRealm" key-store="qsTrustStore"/>

<aggregate-realm name="QuickstartRealm" authentication-realm="KeyStoreRealm" authorization-realm="ApplicationRealm"/>
----
+
The `aggregate-realm` defines different security realms for authentication and authorization. In this case, the `KeyStoreRealm` is responsible for authenticating the principal extracted from the client's certificate and the `ApplicationRealm` is responsible for obtaining the roles required to access the application.

. The following `principal-decoder` and `security-domain` were added to the `elytron` subsystem:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<x500-attribute-principal-decoder name="QuickstartDecoder" attribute-name="cn"/>

<security-domain name="QuickstartDomain" default-realm="QuickstartRealm" permission-mapper="default-permission-mapper" principal-decoder="QuickstartDecoder">
    <realm name="QuickstartRealm" role-decoder="groups-to-roles"/>
</security-domain>
----
+
The `x500-attribute-principal-decoder` creates a new `Principal` from the CN attribute of the `X500Principal` obtained from the client's certificate. This new principal is supplied to the security realms and is also the principal returned in methods like `getUserPrincipal` and `getCallerPrincipal`.

. The following `http-authentication-factory` was added to the `elytron` subsystem:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<http-authentication-factory name="quickstart-http-authentication" http-server-mechanism-factory="global" security-domain="QuickstartDomain">
    <mechanism-configuration>
        <mechanism mechanism-name="CLIENT_CERT"/>
    </mechanism-configuration>
</http-authentication-factory>
----
+
It defines the security domain that will handle requests using the `CLIENT_CERT` HTTP mechanism.

. The `https-listener` in the `undertow` subsystem was changed to reference the `qsSSLContext` `ssl-context`:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<https-listener name="https" socket-binding="https" ssl-context="qsSSLContext" enable-http2="true"/>
----

. The following `application-security-domain` was added to the `undertow` subsystem:
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<application-security-domains>
    <application-security-domain name="client_cert_domain" http-authentication-factory="quickstart-http-authentication"/>
</application-security-domains>
----
+
It maps the `client_cert_domain` from the quickstart application to the `http-authentication-factory` shown above, so requests made to the application go through the configured HTTP authentication factory.
