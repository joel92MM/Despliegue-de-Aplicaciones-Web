[abstract]
Demonstrates how to use the Wicket Framework 7.x with the JBoss server using the Wicket Jakarta EE integration, packaged as an EAR

:standalone-server-type: default
:archiveType: ear

== What is it?

This is an example of how to use Wicket Framework 7.x with WildFly, leveraging features of {javaVersion}, using the Wicket Jakarta EE integration.

Features used:

* Injection of `@PersistenceContext`
* Injection of a value from `web.xml` using `@Resource`
* Injection of a stateless session bean using `@EJB`

This is an EAR version, with the following structure:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
-`wicket-ear` - parent module
    - `ejb`: Contains EJB beans and JPA entities. Creates a `.jar` file
    - `war`: Contains the Wicket web application, which uses the EJB beans. Creates a `.war` file
    - `ear`: Packages the EJB JAR and WAR into an EAR. Creates an `.ear` file

== Debug the Application

If you want to debug the source code or look at the Javadocs of any library in the project, run either of the following commands to pull them into your local repository. The IDE should then detect them.
