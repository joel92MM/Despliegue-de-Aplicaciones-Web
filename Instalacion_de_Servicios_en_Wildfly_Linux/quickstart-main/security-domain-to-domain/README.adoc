== What is it?

The `security-domain-to-domain` quickstart demonstrates the propagation of an identity across two different deployments using different security domains.

When you deploy this example, one user is automatically created for you: user `quickstartUser` with password `quickstartPwd1!` This data is located in the `web/src/main/resources/import.sql` file.

This quickstart takes the following steps to implement Servlet security:

Web Application::

* Adds a security constraint to the Servlet using the `@ServletSecurity` and `@HttpConstraint` annotations.
* Adds a security domain reference to `WEB-INF/jboss-web.xml`.
* Adds a `login-config` that sets the `auth-method` to `BASIC` in the `WEB-INF/web.xml`.

EJB Application::

* Adds a security domain reference using the @org.jboss.ejb3.annotation.SecurityDomain annotation.

Application Server (`standalone.xml`)::

* Defines a security domain in the `elytron` subsystem that uses the JDBC security realm to obtain the security data used to authenticate and authorize users.
* Defined a second security domain in the `elytron` subsystem similar to the first but with different role mappings.
* Defines an `http-authentication-factory` in the `elytron` subsystem that uses the security domain created in step 1 for BASIC authentication.
* Adds an `application-security-domain` mapping in the `undertow` subsystem to map the Servlet security domain to the HTTP authentication factory defined in step 3.
* Adds an `application-security-domain` mapping in the `ejb3` subystem to map the EJBs security domain to the security domain defined in step 2.
Database Configuration::

* Adds an application user with access rights to the application.

== Configure the {productName} Server

You can configure the server by running JBoss CLI commands. For your convenience, this quickstart batches the commands into a `configure-server.cli` script provided in the root directory of this quickstart.

. Before you begin, make sure you do the following:

* xref:back_up_standalone_server_configuration[Back up the {productName} standalone server configuration] as described above.
* xref:start_the_eap_standalone_server[Start the {productName} server] with the standalone default profile as described above.

. Review the `configure-server.cli` file in the root of this quickstart directory. This script adds security domain and HTTP authentication factory to the `elytron` subsystem in the server configuration and also configures the `undertow` subsystem to use the configured HTTP authentication factory for the Web application.
. Open a new command prompt, navigate to the root directory of this quickstart, and run the following command, replacing __{jbossHomeName}__ with the path to your server:
+
[source,subs="+quotes,attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=configure-server.cli
----
+
NOTE: For Windows, use the `__{jbossHomeName}__\bin\jboss-cli.bat` script.
+

You should see the following result when you run the script:
+
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
The batch executed successfully
----

. Stop the {productName} server.

== Review the Modified Server Configuration

After stopping the server, open the `__{jbossHomeName}__/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file and review the changes.

. The following datasource was added to the `datasources` subsystem.
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<datasource jndi-name="java:jboss/datasources/SecurityDomainToDomainDS" pool-name="SecurityDomainToDomainDS">
    <connection-url>jdbc:h2:mem:servlet-security;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE</connection-url>
    <driver>h2</driver>
    <security>
        <user-name>sa</user-name>
        <password>sa</password>
    </security>
</datasource>
----

. The following security realms were added to the `elytron` subsystem.
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<jdbc-realm name="entry-realm">
    <principal-query sql="SELECT PASSWORD FROM USERS WHERE USERNAME = ?" data-source="SecurityDomainToDomainDS">
        <clear-password-mapper password-index="1"/>
    </principal-query>
    <principal-query sql="SELECT R.NAME, 'Roles' FROM ENTRY_ROLES ER INNER JOIN ROLES R ON R.ID = ER.ROLE_ID INNER JOIN USERS U ON U.ID = ER.USER_ID WHERE U.USERNAME = ?" data-source="SecurityDomainToDomainDS">
        <attribute-mapping>
            <attribute to="roles" index="1"/>
        </attribute-mapping>
    </principal-query>
</jdbc-realm>
----

. The `entry-realm` security realm is responsible for verifying the credentials for a given principal and for obtaining security attributes (like roles) that are associated with the authenticated identity.
+
[source, xml]
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<jdbc-realm name="business-realm">
    <principal-query sql="SELECT PASSWORD FROM USERS WHERE USERNAME = ?" data-source="SecurityDomainToDomainDS">
        <clear-password-mapper password-index="1"/>
    </principal-query>
    <principal-query sql="SELECT R.NAME, 'Roles' FROM BUSINESS_ROLES BR INNER JOIN ROLES R ON R.ID = BR.ROLE_ID INNER JOIN USERS U ON U.ID = BR.USER_ID WHERE U.USERNAME = ?" data-source="SecurityDomainToDomainDS">
        <attribute-mapping>
            <attribute to="roles" index="1"/>
        </attribute-mapping>
    </principal-query>
</jdbc-realm>
----

. The `business-realm` security realm is just used for loading the identity as it accesses the EJB.

. The following `role-decoder` was added to the `elytron` subsystem.
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<simple-role-decoder name="from-roles-attribute" attribute="roles"/>
----
+
The realms in this quickstart store the roles associated with a principal in an attribute named roles. Other realms might use different attributes for roles (such as `group`). The purpose of a `role-decoder` is to instruct the security domain how roles are to be retrieved from an authorized identity.

. The following security domains were added to the `elytron` subsystem.
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<security-domain name="entry-security-domain" default-realm="entry-realm" permission-mapper="default-permission-mapper" outflow-security-domains="business-security-domain">
    <realm name="entry-realm" role-decoder="from-roles-attribute"/>
</security-domain>

<security-domain name="business-security-domain" default-realm="business-realm" trusted-security-domains="entry-security-domain">
    <realm name="business-realm" role-decoder="from-roles-attribute"/>
</security-domain>
----
+
The `entry-security-domain` is configured to automatically outflow any identities to the `business-security-domain` and in return the `business-security-domain` is configured to trust any identities coming from the `entry-security-domain`.

. The following `http-authentication-factory` was added to the `elytron` subsystem.
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<http-authentication-factory name="security-domain-to-domain-http" security-domain="entry-security-domain" http-server-mechanism-factory="global">
    <mechanism-configuration>
        <mechanism mechanism-name="BASIC">
            <mechanism-realm realm-name="RealmUsersRoles"/>
        </mechanism>
    </mechanism-configuration>
</http-authentication-factory>
----
+
It basically defines an HTTP authentication factory for the BASIC mechanism that relies on the `entry-security-domain` security domain to authenticate and authorize access to Web applications.

. The following `application-security-domain` was added to the `undertow` subsystem.
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<application-security-domains>
    <application-security-domain name="EntryDomain" http-authentication-factory="security-domain-to-domain-http"/>
</application-security-domains>
----
+
This configuration tells `Undertow` that applications with the `EntryDomain` security domain, as defined in the `jboss-web.xml` or by using the `@SecurityDomain` annotation in the Servlet class, should use the `http-authentication-factory` named `security-domain-to-domain-http`.

. The following `application-security-domain` was added to the `ejb3` subsystem.
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<application-security-domains>
    <application-security-domain name="BusinessDomain" security-domain="business-security-domain"/>
</application-security-domains>
----
+
This configuration tells `EJB3` that applications with the `BusinessDomain` security domain, as defined in the `jboss.xml` or by using the `@SecurityDomain` annotation in the EJB class, should use the `security-domain` named `business-security-domain`.

. When you have finished reviewing the configuration changes, xref:start_the_eap_standalone_server[start the {productName} server] with the standalone default profile as described above before you build and deploy the quickstart.

//  Build and Deploy the Quickstart

== Access the Application

The application will be running at the following URL: http://localhost:8080/{artifactId}/

When you access the application, you should get a browser login challenge.

Log in using the username `quickstartUser` and password `quickstartPwd1!`. The browser will display the following security info:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
Successfully called Secured Servlet
Identity as visible to servlet.

Principal : quickstartUser

Remote User : quickstartUser

Authentication Type : BASIC

Caller Has Role 'User'=true

Caller Has Role 'Manager'=false
Identity as visible to EJB.

Principal : quickstartUser

Caller Has Role 'User'=false

Caller Has Role 'Manager'=true
----

This shows that the user `quickstartUser` calls the servlet and has role `User` but does not have the role `Manager`, as the call reaches the EJB the principal is still `quickstartUser` but now the identity does not have the role `User` and instead has the role `Manager`.

== Server Log: Expected Warnings and Errors

You will see the following warning in the server log. You can ignore it.

== Restore the Server Configuration

You can restore the original server configuration by running the `restore-configuration.cli` script provided in the root directory of this quickstart or by manually restoring the back-up copy the configuration file.

// Additional informatin about this script
This script removes the `application-security-domain` configurations from the `ejb3` and `undertow` subsystem, the `http-authentication-factory`, `security-domain`, `security-realm` and `role-decoder` configuration from the `elytron` subsystem and it also removes the `datasource` used for this quickstart. You should see the following result when you run the script:
