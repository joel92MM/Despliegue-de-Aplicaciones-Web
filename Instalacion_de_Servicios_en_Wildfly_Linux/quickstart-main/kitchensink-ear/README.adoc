[abstract]
The `kitchensink-ear` quickstart demonstrates web-enabled database application, using JSF, CDI, EJB, JPA, and Bean Validation, packaged as an EAR.

== What is it?

The `kitchensink-ear` quickstart is a deployable Maven 3 project to help you get your foot in the door developing with {javaVersion} on {productNameFull}.

It demonstrates how to create a compliant {javaVersion} application using JSF, CDI, JAX-RS, EJB, JPA, and Bean Validation. It includes a persistence unit and some sample persistence and transaction code to introduce you to database access in enterprise Java. It is based on the link:../kitchensink/README.adoc[kitchensink] quickstart but is packaged as an EAR archive.
