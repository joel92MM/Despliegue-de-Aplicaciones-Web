[abstract]
The `ejb-txn-remote-call` quickstart demonstrates remote transactional EJB calls over two application servers of {productName}.

== What is it?

The `ejb-txn-remote-call` quickstart demonstrates the remote transactional EJB calls over two application servers of {productNameFull}. The remote side forms a HA cluster.

== Description

The EJB remote call propagates a JTA transaction. Further, the quickstart demonstrates the transaction recovery, which is run for both servers when a failure occurs.

This quickstart contains two Maven projects.
The first maven project represents the sender side, and is intended to be deployed on the first server (`server1`).
The second project represents the called side. This project is intended to be deployed
to the other two servers (`server2` and `server3`). The two projects should not be deployed to the same server.

|===
|Project |Description

|`client`
|An application that you deploy to the first server, to `server1`.
It includes REST endpoints that provide EJB remote calls to the `server application`
residing on the other servers.
In addition, the remote EJB calls the REST endpoint invocation process to insert data into a database.
The REST invocation starts a transaction that enlists two participants
(the database and the EJB remote invocation).
The transaction manager then uses the two-phase commit to commit the transaction
over the two servers.
Further, the quickstart examines failures and shows the transactional behaviour
in such cases.

|`server`
|An application that receives the remote EJB calls from the `client` application.
This `server` application is deployed to `server2` and `server3`.
The EJB component receives the EJB remote call and, depending on the scenario,
resumes on the transaction propagated in the context of the remote EJB call.
The call inserts data to the database.
The propagated transaction enlists two participants
(the database, and a mock XAResource used for quickstart demonstration purposes).
|===

== Running the Quickstart

The quickstart elaborates on running the example in <<_running_in_a_bare_metal_environment, a bare metal environment>> and on OpenShift.

// System Requirements
include::../shared-doc/system-requirements.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
// Use of {jbossHomeName}_1 and {jbossHomeName}_2
include::../shared-doc/use-of-jboss-home-name.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// Run the Quickstart in Red Hat CodeReady Studio or Eclipse
include::../shared-doc/run-the-quickstart-in-jboss-developer-studio.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== The Goal

Your goal is to set up and start 3 {productName} servers, first deploys the `client`
application the other two configure a cluster and deploy the `server` application.
The EJB remote call propagates transaction from `client` application
to `server` application. The remote call hits one of the two servers where the `server` application is deployed.

== Running in a bare metal environment

[[_setup_productname_servers]]
=== Setup {productName} servers

The easiest way to start multiple instances on a local computer is to copy the {productName} installation directory
to three separate directories.

The installation directory for `server1` (`client` application) is named `__{jbossHomeName}_1__`,
for `server2` it is named `__{jbossHomeName}_2__` (`server` application) and for `server3` it is named `__{jbossHomeName}_3__` (`server` application).

[source,sh,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
# considering the ${jbossHomeName} is installation directory of the {productName}
cp -r ${jbossHomeName} server1
{jbossHomeName}_1="$PWD/server1"
cp -r ${jbossHomeName} server2
{jbossHomeName}_2="$PWD/server2"
cp -r ${jbossHomeName} server3
{jbossHomeName}_3="$PWD/server3"
----

=== Configure EJB remoting, and authentication of the remote call

To successfully process the remote call  from `server1` to either `server2`
or to `server3` you must create a user on the receiver server
that the remote call will be authenticated to.

Run the following procedure in the directories `__{jbossHomeName}_2__` and `__{jbossHomeName}_3__` to create the user for `server2` and `server3`.

[#add_application_user]
// Add the Authorized Application User
include::../shared-doc/add-application-user.adoc[leveloffset=+3]

[NOTE]
====
For the `add-user.sh` (or `.bat`) command you, can add the parameter `-ds`.
When you include this parameter, after the user is added, the system outputs a secret value that you can use to set up the remote output connection on `server1`.

The output of command when `-ds` parameter is used:

[code,sh]
----
To represent the user add the following to the server-identities definition <secret value="cXVpY2tzdGFydFB3ZDEh" />
----
====

Now, you must configure `server1` to authenticate with the remote side when
the EJB call is invoked.
See the script `${PATH_TO_QUICKSTART_DIR}/ejb-txn-remote-call/client/extensions/remote-configuration.cli`
to review the commands that will be executed.
The `cli` script is configured with `cli.local.properties`
to run in https://wildfly.org/news/2015/03/13/Offline-CLI/[embedded mode] against the `standalone.xml`.

=== Configure datasources

The EJBs perform transactional work against a database, so the servers need
to know how to connect to that database. The following steps shows how to configure
an XA datasource with the name `ejbJtaDs` for connecting to a PostgreSQL database.

[NOTE]
====

First you need a database running.
The following https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_POSTGRESQL.md#download-and-install-postgresql[procedure] briefly summarizes the steps required to configure PostgreSQL.

For local testing purposes you can use a simple docker container:

[source,sh]
----
docker run -p 5432:5432 --rm  -ePOSTGRES_DB=test -ePOSTGRES_USER=test -ePOSTGRES_PASSWORD=test postgres:9.4 -c max-prepared-transactions=110 -c log-statement=all

[#_start_productname_servers]
=== Start {productName} servers

When the setup was done you can start the servers.
Start the `server1` with the `standalone.xml` configuration.
The `server2` and the `server3` comprise a cluster, you need to start them
with the `standalone-ha.xml` configuration.

For starting at the same machine you need to use the port offset
to bind every server at a different port.
Each server has to define a unique transaction node id and jboss node name.
Use the system properties `jboss.tx.node.id` and `jboss.node.name` when starting the servers.
The configuration file `custom-config.xml` refers to application user's credentials
and making possible for the transaction recovery to authenticate to recover the remote transaction failure.

Start each server in a separate terminal.

[#_examining_the_quickstart]
=== Examining the Quickstart

After the {productName} servers are configured and started, and the quickstart artifacts are deployed
you can invoke the methods and examine their results.

The `client.war` deployed to `server1` exposes several endpoints that invoke
EJB remote invocations to the HA cluster that `server2` and `server3` formed.

The expected behaviour varies depending on type
of the remote call. It depends on running the call as part of the transaction &ndash;
then the transaction affinity makes all calls to hit the same server instance.
When the calls go to stateful EJB then the affinity again ensures
the multiple calls hitting the same server instance (the calls to stateful EJB are sticky).
When the call runs against the stateless EJB out of the transaction context then
the calls should be load balanced over the both servers in the HA cluster.
The following table defines the available endpoints, and the expected behaviour
when they are invoked.

[NOTE]
====
The endpoints return data in JSON format. You can use `curl` for invocation
and `jq` command to format the results. For example:
`curl -s http://localhost:8080/client/remote-outbound-stateless | jq .`
====

[NOTE]
====
On Windows, the `curl` and `jq` commands might not be available.
If so, enter the endpoints directly to a browser of your choice.
The behaviour and the obtained JSON will be the same as for the `curl` command.
====

The HTTP invocations return the hostnames of the contacted servers.

[[rest-endpoints]]
[options="headers"]
.HTTP endpoints of the test invocation
|===
|URL |Behaviour |Expectation

|__http://localhost:8080/client/remote-outbound-stateless__
|Two invocations under the transaction context started on `server1` (`client` application).
The EJB remote call is configured from the `remote-outbound-connection`.
Both calls are directed to the same remote server instance (`server` application)
due to transaction affinity.
|The two returned hostnames must be the same.

|__http://localhost:8080/client/remote-outbound-notx-stateless__
|Seven remote invocations to stateless EJB without a transaction context.
The EJB remote call is configured from the `remote-outbound-connection`.
The EJB client is expected to load balance the calls on various servers.
|The list of the returned hostnames should contain occurrences of both
 `server2` and `server3`.

|__http://localhost:8080/client/direct-stateless__
|Two invocations under the transaction context started on `server1` (`client` application). The stateless bean is invoked on the remote side.
The EJB remote call is configured from data in the `client` application source code.
The remote invocation is run via the EJB remoting protocol.
|The returned hostnames must be the same.

|__http://localhost:8080/client/direct-stateless-http__
|Two invocations under the transaction context started on `server1` (`client` application). The stateless bean is invoked on the remote side.
The EJB remote call is configured from data in the `client` application source code.
The remote invocation is run, unlike the other calls of this quickstarts, via https://docs.wildfly.org/22/Developer_Guide.html#EJB_over_HTTP[EJB over HTTP].
|The returned hostnames must be the same.

|__http://localhost:8080/client/remote-outbound-notx-stateful__
|Two invocations under the transaction context stared on `server1` (`client` application).
The EJB remote call is configured from the `remote-outbound-connection`.
Both calls are directed to the same stateful bean on the remote server because
the stateful bean invocations are sticky ensuring affinity to the same server instance.
|The returned hostnames must be the same.

|__http://localhost:8080/client/remote-outbound-fail-stateless__
|An invocation under the transaction context started on `server1` (`client` application).
The call goes to one of the remote servers, where errors occur during transaction processing.
The failure is simulated at time of two-phase commit.
This HTTP call finishes with success. Only the server log shows some warnings.
This is an expected behaviour. An intermittent failure during commit phase
of two-phase protocol makes the transaction manager obliged to finish the work
eventually. The finalization of work is done in the background
(by Narayana recovery manager, see details <<_details_on_recovery, below>>), and the HTTP call may inform the client back with success.
|When the recovery manager finishes the work all the transaction resources are committed.

|===

[[_details_on_recovery]]
==== Observing the recovery processing after __client/remote-outbound-fail-stateless__ call

The EJB call simulates the presence of an intermittent network error
happening at the commit phase of two-phase commit protocol (2PC).

The http://jbossts.blogspot.com/2018/01/narayana-periodic-recovery-of-xa.html[transaction recovery manager]
periodically retries to recover the unfinished work.
When it makes the work successfully committed, the transaction is complete,
and the database update will be visible. You can confirm the database update
was processed by issuing REST endpoint reporting number of finished commits.

You can invoke the endpoint `server/commits` at both servers `server2` and `server3`
where `server` application is deployed (i.e. __http://localhost:8180/server/commits__
and __http://localhost:8280/server/commits__).
The output of this command is a tuple. It shows the node info, and the number of commits recorded. For example the output could be `["host: mydev.narayana.io/192.168.0.1, jboss node name: server2","3"]` and it says that the hostname is `mydev.narayana.io`, the jboss node name is `server2`,
and the number of commits is `3`.

Transaction recovery manager runs periodically (by default, it runs every 2 minutes)
on all servers. The transaction was initiated on `server1`,
and you will need to wait until is initiated there.

[NOTE]
====
You can speed up the process and invoke the recovery process manually by accessing
the port on which the recovery process listens.
When the https://docs.wildfly.org/22/wildscribe/subsystem/transactions/index.html#attr-recovery-listener[listener is enabled] you can force the recovery to start on demand.
Use `telnet` to send the `SCAN` command to the recovery manager socket at `localhost:4712`.

== Running on OpenShift

=== OpenShift deployment

Before deploying this quickstart to OpenShift Container Platform we need to inspect
a bit the platform. The {productName} server runs in a pod. The pod is an ephemeral object
that could be rescheduled, restarted or moved to a different machine by the platform.
The ephemeral nature of the pod is a poor match for the transaction manager handling transactions
and for EJB remoting passing the context as well.
The transaction manager requires a persistent log to be saved
for each {productName} server instance.
The EJB remoting requires a stable remote endpoint for connection to guarantee
the state of stateful beans and the transaction affinity.
The stability of the remote endpoint address is important for transaction
recovery calls to eventually finish the transactions too.
For these properties being guaranteed from the platform
we use _StatefulSet_ object in OpenShift.

The recommended way to deploy applications to {productName} is using
the {productName} Operator which utilizes the StatefulSet to manage {productName}
as the default option in the background.

NOTE: link:../shared-doc/cd-openshift-getting-started.adoc[Other quickstarts discuss deploying]
      of the applications with _ReplicaSet_ defined by DeploymentConfig in a template.
      It's a different approach that does not match well with the transaction affinity
      and cannot be used here.

==== Running on OpenShift: Build the application

For building the application the {productName} s2i functionality
(provided out-of-boxy by OpenShift) needs to be used.

The {productName} provides `ImageStream` definition of builder images and runtime images.
The builder image makes the application to be build, configure the application server
with s2i scripts. The resulted image may be used for running,
but it's big as it contains many dependencies needed only for the build.
The chain build defines the next step which is to get the runtime image
and copy there the configured {productName} server with the application.

Wait for the builds to finish. You can verify the build status by executing
the `oc get pod` command.

The expected output, after few whiles, shows that the `*-build` jobs
have got the value `Completed` in the `STATUS` column.

==== Running on OpenShift: Install {productName} Operator

With the prior step we have got the application image with the server being part of.
The next step is to install the {productName} Operator which is responsible
for managing the life cycle of the application image.

ifndef::ProductRelease,EAPCDRelease,EAPXPRelease[]
Manual installation of the {productName} Operator on OpenShift is summarized in the script
https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-operator/blob/master/build/run-openshift.sh[build/run-openshift.sh].

[#_running_on_openshift_run_the_quickstart_with_productname_operator]
==== Running on OpenShift: Run the Quickstart with {productName} Operator

After you install the {productName} Operator, you can deploy the`CustomResource` that uses it.
The `CustomResource.yaml` definition contains information the {productName} Operator uses
to start the application pods for the client application and for the server application.

Before deploying the application, ensure the `view` permissions for the default system account
is set up. The `KUBE_PING` protocol, that is used for forming the HA {productName} cluster
on OpenShift, requires `view` permissions to read labels of pods.

[source,sh]
----
oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:$(oc project -q):default -n $(oc project -q)
----

After granting the permissions, deploy the `CustomResource`, managed by {productName} Operator
that, referencing to the <<_running_on_openshift_build_the_application, built application images>>.

[CAUTION]
====
Adjust the value of the `applicationImage` value in the OpenShift deployment templates
`${PATH_TO_QUICKSTART_DIR}/ejb-txn-remote-call/client/client-cr.yaml` and
`${PATH_TO_QUICKSTART_DIR}/ejb-txn-remote-call/server/server-cr.yaml`
to match the project. It is the most probably {artifactId}-project.

cd ${PATH_TO_QUICKSTART_DIR}

oc create -f ejb-txn-remote-call/client/client-cr.yaml
# deploying server definition, two replicas, PostgreSQL database has to be available
oc create -f ejb-txn-remote-call/server/server-cr.yaml
----

If these commands are successful, the `oc get pod` command shows
all the pods required for the quickstart, namely the quickstart client and two
server pods and the PostgreSQL database pod that the application connects to.

==== Running on OpenShift: Quickstart application removal

To remove the application you need to remove the `WildFlyServer` definition
(which was deployed by <<_running_on_openshift_run_the_quickstart_with_productname_operator,`*-cr` yaml descriptor>>).
You can do that by running `oc remove WildFlyServer client`
and `oc remove WildFlyServer server`.
With that the application will be stopped, and the pods will be removed.

== Conclusion

This quickstarts is a showcase for the EJB remoting calls from one {productName} server
to other with transaction propagation being involved.
It shows things from multiple areas from setting-up the datasources, through security definition
for remote connection, EJB remoting in the application, up to observing the transaction recovery processing.
On top of that it shows running this all in OpenShift managed with {productName} Operator.
